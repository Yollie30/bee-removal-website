          <h2>🍯 Honey Production</h2>
          <p>After relocation, the bees are rehabilitated in a safe environment where they can thrive and make honey. When the bees have filled their frames with honey, we collect the honey using a manual drum spinner. The honey is filtered to remove impurities and poured into clean, labeled bottles ready for you to enjoy.</p>
