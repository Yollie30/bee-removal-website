                <h2> The BuzzZ on bees</h2>
                <p>Bees play a crucial role in pollination and maintaining a healthy ecosystem.<br>
                    Without them, many plants, including important food crops, wouldn‚Äôt be able to reproduce.<br>
                    As they move from flower to flower collecting nectar, they spread pollen that helps plants grow, breed, and produce food.<br>
                    Their work supports the growth of trees, flowers, and other plants that serve as food and shelter for countless species.<br>
                    Protecting bees means protecting biodiversity and the balance of our natural world.</p>

                        <li>Bees communicate with each other through a special ‚Äúwaggle dance‚Äù to share information about the location of food sources.</li>
                        <li>Honeybees have five eyes: two large compound eyes and three smaller simple eyes on top of their heads.</li>
                        <li>Bees have tiny hairs all over their bodies that help them collect pollen.</li>
